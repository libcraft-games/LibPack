# LibPack
Custom Minecraft modpack for NeoForge 1.21.1.

## Installation
You will need an unofficial launcher - if you don't have one, [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/) is recommended.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The CurseForge launcher does not support `.mrpack` files and cannot be used to install the LibPack.

Once the launcher is installed, just grab the most recent release from [the releases page](https://github.com/libcraft-games/LibPack/releases/) - it will be the `.mrpack` file under the "assets" section.

> [!TIP]
> You can just drag the `.mrpack` file into your launcher to install it, at least if you're using Prism or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/app). 

A few mods are marked as optional, generally due to potential annoyance. Select any or all of them based on your preferences.

As of 0.8.1, these are:
- [ThreatenGL](https://modrinth.com/mod/threatengl), which forces Minecraft to use newer OpenGL versions, which might increase performance;
- [Dynamic FPS](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), which harshly caps Minecraft's FPS when it's not focused, to reduce load when you alt-tab;
- [Villager Trading Plus](https://modrinth.com/mod/trading+), which allows you to shift-click to perform as many trades as a villager can;
- and [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons), which massively increases Minecraft's render distance at the cost of substantially increased performance requirements.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Distant Horizons should only be enabled if you have plenty of RAM, VRAM, and CPU capacity to handle the increased load.

Once it's installed, make sure to allocate enough RAM! In Prism, you can do this by clicking the instance and selecting `Edit...` > `Settings` > `Memory`.

> [!NOTE]
> The modpack was designed to use **8GB** (8192 MiB), but you *might* be able to get away with less.
