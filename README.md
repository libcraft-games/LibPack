# LibPack
Custom Minecraft modpack for NeoForge 1.21.1.

## Installation
You will need an unofficial launcher - if you don't have one, [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/) is recommended. **CurseForge does not support the filetype we use.**

Once the launcher is installed, just grab the most recent release from [the releases page](https://github.com/libcraft-games/LibPack/releases/) - it will be the `.mrpack` file under the "assets" section. You can install it by just dragging the file into your launcher - at least if it's Prism or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/app), but most unofficial launchers support  `.mrpack` files these days.

Your launcher will prompt you to select some optional mods, which mostly provide small utilities or optimization options. i recommend that most people select all of them, but Distant Horizons is very performance-intensive, so you might want to skip it.
