[general]
	#
	#How dynamic assets are generated.
	#- NEVER: No asset will be generated. Use this if you have an external pack that adds assets for the block, otherwise you'll get missing assets everywhere
	#- RUN_ONCE: Assets will be generated once every session. Subsequent reloads of resource/data pack will not regenerate them even if assets might have changed as a consequence
	#- CACHED: Generate the assets on first boot and saves them to a cache folder in .minecraft/dynamic-data-pack-cache. If mods or packs change it will regenerate the cache. If not, subsequent reload won't generate anything and just read the cached ones as a normal pack.
	#- CACHED_ZIPPED: Generate the assets on first boot and saves them to a cache zip file in .minecraft/dynamic-data-pack-cache. If mods or packs change it will regenerate the cache. If not, subsequent reload won't generate anything and just read the cached ones as a normal pack.
	#- ALWAYS: Will always generate the assets & will be stored in memory. No cache is used. Unintuitively, this is often the fastest method as any disk access will be slow. 
	#Try and see what works best for you.
